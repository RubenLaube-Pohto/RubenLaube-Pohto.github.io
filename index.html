          Full Stack Developer Looking for the Truth of Code
        </p>

        <p>
          Born in Oulu but not raised there I've lived in a few different cities in Finland. What brought me to
          <b>Turku</b> was my spouse's studies. We fell in love with the city and with my experience this feels like one
          of the best cities in the country.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fall of 2014 marks my beginning on the path. I started in the <b>JAMK University of Applied Sciences</b> as a
          fresh novice. After a few years I was fortunate enough to get employed and got drawn into the world of full
          stack. There I've remained for <b>over two years</b> and enjoyed the stay to this day!
        </p>

        <p>
          Working between the planes of frontend and backend I've learned to utilize
          <b>Angular, Ionic, Node, Google Cloud Platform and Firebase</b>. Many other tools go into the mix to
          complement these. The projects have ranged from POCs and MVPs to bigger industry apps that clients are using
          internally to manage their own processes. My roles have varied from an independent adventurer to a team
          contributor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Learning the Truth behind great code and solutions that make the hearts of users and developers alike flutter
          is what drives me professionally. What I really enjoy outside it are great stories, be it in cinema, books or
          games. I'd never turn down an evening with friends either.
        </p>
