          JS Fullstack Developer Looking for the Truth of Code
        </p>

        <p>
          Fall of 2014 marks my beginning on the path. I started in the JAMK University of Applied Siences. After a few
          years I was fortunate enough to get employed and got drawn into the world of fullstack. There I've remained to
          this day.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working between the planes of frontend and backend I've learned to utilize
          <span class="portfolio--emphasis">Angular, Ionic, Node, Google Cloud Platform and Firebase</span>. Many other
          tools go into the mix to complement these. The projects have ranged from POCs and MVPs to bigger industry apps
          that clients are using internally to manage their own processes. My roles have ranged from an independent
          adventurer to a team contributor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Learning the Truth behind great code and solutions that make the hearts of users and developers alike flutter
          is what drives me professionally. What I really enjoy outside it are great stories, be it in cinema, books or
          games.
